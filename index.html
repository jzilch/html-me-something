      <h2><em>Cooking</em></h2>
      <p>
      I enjoy cooking alot of different food from all over the world. My girlfriend made me
      realize how easy it is cook with very little knowledge. I started learning how to cook
      vegetarian food because she is a vegetarian. We both enjoy cooking most nights we spend
      together. We try to cook everything from scratch because we feel it gives more meaning,
      we enjoy sharing meals we made with other, start eating healthier and gaining confidence
      that we can adaquately feed ourselves. It also brings us together and learn how to work
      together which has helped us become more close with one another. Here are a few meals we
      have made together.

      Our inspiration mainly comes from the grocery store. We try many different ethnic stores
      to find new ingrediants to work with. I enjoy asian cuisane the most because it incorporates
      many different spices and flavors with lots of new ingrediants.

      We even made some indian food recently. The best part about this one was making the Paneer. We 
      have never made cheese before so this one was very enjoyable and rewarding. We learned how to use
      a cheese cloth, and make our own marsala spice.

        Alton brown is one of my favorite cooks to watch. His show Good Eats is a very good show to learn
        basics about ingrediants and how they fit into different recipes. Just recently we learned how to
        cook Pad Thai. This recipe included more than 15 different ingrediants and only takes 25 minutes
        to cook.

      <h2><em>Dungeons and Dragons</em></h2>
      <p>Another passion of mine is playing Dungeons and Dragons with my friends. I play every other
        Sunday with my girlfriend and her brother. Also every Monday night after Launchcode I play with
        some of my closest friends. I've only been playing for a year and half now and have already
        played in 4 different campaigns. I enjoy playing "DnD" because you can roleplay but its also 
        similar to playing video games which is a big part of my life. Its taught me to be more vocal in
        groups of people and acting. I plan on starting my own campaign later this year with my family.

      <p>Dungeons and Dragons is about imagination, playing and socializing with friends with a pencil and
      paper solving problems/puzzles, performing, being creative, and working with other are some
      of the many reasons I continue to play. Also its alot of fun.

      <h2><em>Geocaching</em></h2>
      <p>
      Geocaching is the recreational activity of hunting for and finding a hidden object by means of GPS coordinates
      post on a community website. Geocaching is my active hoppy. Me and my girlfriend love geocaching on
      nice summer days. We both enjoy hiking and outdoors, so geocaching is a fun way for us to familiarize 
      ourself with the landscape and new areas and parks we have never been too. The joy is finding hidden
      "caches" in the trees, logs, swamps, rocks, tall grass, and many more places. You get some coordinates
      and some clues to track them down. When you find the "cache" there is sometimes paper to write your name
      on to show you've been there and little trinkets that you swap with trinkets you have.
      </p>

      Anyone can make their own cache and include anything they want inside. Which introduces trackables.
      Trackables are trinkets that one places inside their cache and try to get it to another location.
      One trackable I just found started its journey in Hawaii and now is in St. Louis on its way across
      the US.
